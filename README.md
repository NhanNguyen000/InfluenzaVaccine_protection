# CiiM | Influenza project, seroprotection-based classfication

## Description
This repository for analysing the serological and multi-omics data from iMED and ZirFLu (influenza-vaccinated cohorts) in R. The multi-omics data includes plasma metabolomic, plasma proteomics, bulk transcriptomics, and single-cell transcriptomics data derived from donors' blood samples.s


## Instructions
- The **data** folder stores information and reference files 
- The **processedData** folder stores intermediate data files which are byproducts of the data analysis and are used to produce plots.
- The **scripts** is the R and shell script to run the data analysis. The filenames of the script files contain sequence numbers that determine their executive order.
- The **output** folder store the outcome of the data analysis, including:
   - Plots for main and supplement figures (.png and .svg formats) derived fro
   - The **qtl** folder store the outcome of the QTL analysiss
   - The **pathwayAnalsysis_allSigMebos** folder store the outcome of pathway analysis from the Metabo Analyst website ([metaboanalyst.ca](https://www.metaboanalyst.ca))
- The **temp** folder stores data, code, outcome at the development phase, which is a preliminary stage before the final analysis.
- The **sendOut** folder contains data, code, outcome that were generated for other colleagues' srequests.
